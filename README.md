# Phoenix Math – Automatic Card Remixing for Anki

Given a card with a math problem, Phoenix Math uses an LLM to generate a new version of that problem (along with its answer), allowing the user to memorize concepts and processes rather than the answers to individual problems.

## Supported Note Type

This add-on only works with a specific note setup.

**Note type name**
- `MATH`

**Required fields**
- `MATH QUESTION`
- `MATH ANSWER`

(Note types and field names must match exactly to avoid errors!)

## Configuration

You will need to create a [Gemini API key](https://docs.cloud.google.com/api-keys/docs/get-started-api-keys) for use with this addon. You can configure your key in Tools->Addons->Config. After that, you're set to go!
